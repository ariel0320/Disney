  Cinerella</a></h2>
Once upon a time,<br>there was a girl called Ella.
<br>And she saw the world<br>but as perhaps it could be,
<br>with just a little bit of magic.<br>My darling!
<br>To her mother and father,<br>she was a princess.
<br>True, she had no title,<br>nor crown, nor castle,
<br>but she was the ruler<br>of her own little kingdom,
<br>whose borders were the house<br>and meadow on the forest's edge
<br>where her people<br>had lived for generations.
<br>With Mr. Goose<br>and all their animal family.
